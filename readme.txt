== Description ==
**Do you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/display-posts-shortcode-blurb).**

This plugin is an **extention** of the [Display Posts Shortcode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-posts-shortcode/) plugin. While the *Display Posts Shortcode* is an excellent plugin, it cannot:

* display a call to action link/button
* display an image other than the featured image
* display summary content other than excerpt

Hence this extension.

= How does it work =

The *Display Posts Shortcode Blurb* plugin adds a *blurb meta box* on the post & page edit screens. Add or edit the post's blurb here.

The plugin **overrides** the default output of the [display-posts] shortcode and displays a post's blurb when:

* the 'show_blurb' parameter is set to true, example: [display-posts show_blurb="true"], and
* the post blurb is available

= CSS Styling =

The plugin does not include any styling.
